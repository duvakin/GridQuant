# GridQuant
European market **spot price forecasts** via Monte Carlo analysis and Geometric Brownian Motion.  

## Overview
Today, with cloud storage and AI placing unprecedented strain on the grid, energy security and building operational costs are not only an urban planning concern but a growing business risk.

This python-based package introduces a crucial co-simulation and energy market forecasting method leveraging [Geometric Brownian Motion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/geometric-brownian-motion) (GBM) and [Monte Carlo](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212567114004638) (MC) analysis to forecast energy prices with uncertainty in increasingly more volatile energy markets.

The workflow consists of three key stages:
1. **Data Retrival**:
2. **Empirical Volatility Calculation**:
3. **Stochastic Forecast Simulation**:
